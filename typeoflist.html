                <h1><dt>Dragon</dt></h1>
                <dd>A dragon is a large magical legendary creature that appears 
                    in the folklore of multiple cultures worldwide. Beliefs about 
                    dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in Western 
                    cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as 
                    winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire.</dd>
                <h1><dt>Phoenix</dt></h1>
                <dd>The phoenix is an immortal bird that cyclically regenerates or is 
                    otherwise born again. While it is part of Greek mythology, it has 
                    analogs in many cultures such as Egyptian and Persian. Associated 
                    with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes 
                    of its predecessor.</dd>
                <h1><dt>Vampire</dt></h1>
                <dd>A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the 
                    vital essence of the living. In European folklore, vampires are
                    undead creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief 
                    or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they 
                    were alive.</dd>
                <dt>Werewolf</dt></h1>
                <dd>In folklore, a werewolf, or occasionally lycanthrope is an individual 
                    who can shape-shift into a wolf, either purposely or after being 
                    placed under a curse or affliction, with the transformations occurring 
                    on the night of a full moon.</dd>
